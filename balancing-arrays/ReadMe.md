# Balancing Arrays
====
returns the index of the point in the array where the sum of numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side. 
The BalanceArray#balance_index returns -1 otherwise.

So for the array {1,1,1,1} you could return index 1 as we break the array after the second element to balance it.
