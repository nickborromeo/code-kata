# Playing with Numbers
---

Write a method that would find all positive integers that do not have 0 in their digits, and have a digital sum equal to n. An example of this would be 14  (1+4 =5) if n was 5. 

Output what each of the numbers are

# Counting Ones

Given an array of numbers, return the occurrences of the number 1 in the array. So, if the array contains 1, 2, 11, 13 you would return 4 (as 11 contains two instances of 1).  

NOTE: run count_number.rb

# Fibonacci Sequences

The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So, it looks like

0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21 ......

What you have to do is provide a function that takes a parameter n that returns the Fibonacci number at the nth position.

NOTE: run fibonacci.rb

# Return the Factorial

A function which will return the factorial of a number n. Factorial is the product of the sequence  n, n-1, n-2 .... 1.  And remember that the factorial of 0 is actually 1.
