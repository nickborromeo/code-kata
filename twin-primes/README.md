#Finding Twin Primes
---

Today problem is to find all the twin primes within a certain range. A twin prime is a pair of prime numbers that differs by two. Two examples would be (3,5) and (5,7).  

What you have to do is write a method/function that takes an integer input (let's call it limit) and finds all the twin primes up to that limit.
