# How Many Weekends?
---

The WeekendCalculator class is initialized with two dates and the count_weekends method returns the number of weekends between those dates. If either of the start or end dates is a weekend, you can count that. And whether it's a Saturday or Sunday (doesn't need to include both), it counts.
